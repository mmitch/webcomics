HOW TO USE THE PHP WEBCOMIC BROWSER



== Prerequisites ==

Every directory that contains webcomic data needs these two files:

1)  index file

To speed up the acces to the specific strips within one webcomic (and
to enable the inclusion of stip titles (e.g. Megatokyo)) index files
are used.

The scripts for generating these indexes are already available.  After
running `batch.sh' for a specific comic, just call `mkindex.sh' from
the same directory and you're done.

The batch scripts should set their exit code so that mkindex only gets
called when new strips have been downloaded.  It's safe and most
simple to just do this:

  $ batch.sh && mkindex.sh


2)  COMIC file

The list of available comics is created dynamically from files calles
`COMIC'.  This allows you to just back up some old comics to a CD.  If
you want to browse them again, just mount them somewhere unter
$localpath and they will visible in the comic browser.

The format of a COMIC file is quite simple.  It's just three lines of
plain text.  Use `: ' to separate a keyword from its value:

---example start---
TAG: nichtlustig
NAME: Nichtlustig
HOME: http://www.nichtlustig.de
---example end---

Here is an explanation of the keywords:

TAG:  This is uses in the PHP URL and in the cookie to identify a
      specific webcomic.  Don't use any special characters here
      (everything that has a special meaning in URLs like ` ', `+',
       `?' or `&') is a no-no.  Using just [_a-zA-Z0-9] should be a
      safe bet.

NAME: The name to be displayed in the webcomic index list.

HOME: The original URL of the comic that can be reached via the
      [online] link when a strip is shown.



== Setup ==

1)  Copy `config.inc.template' to `config.inc' and edit the paths to
    your needs.

    It is advised that you use at least a minimal CSS to tame some of
    the bigger images to fit on your screen (Penny Arcade *cough*
    *cough*).  You could include something like this:

@media screen and (min-width: 1000px) {
    img {
	max-width: 100%;
    }
}


2)  Create an empty $cachefile and make it writeable for your PHP
    interpreter.


3)  If you want to use the database backend, you need to create
    a table like this (directly taken from a database dump):

CREATE TABLE `bookmark` (
  `user` varchar(32) NOT NULL default '',
  `comic` varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  `current` smallint(5) NOT NULL default '0',
  PRIMARY KEY  (`user`,`comic`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;


You're done!  Browse the php/index.html and there you go.



== Maintenance ==

If there is a new comic, you need to create a COMIC file.  To make new
comics visible in the comic browser, select "find comics" to recreate
the $cachefile.
